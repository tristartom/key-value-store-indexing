DELI: a Log-Structured Secondary Index for HBase/NoSQL
======

Introduction
------
``DELI`` is a secondary index for NoSQL systems. It currently supports global indexing and is applicable for HBase alike NoSQL systems where write performance is optimized through a LSM tree structure [[link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_merge-tree)]. 

DELI stands for "*DEferred Lightweight Indexing*". Its unique design (given there are other secondary indices for HBase and NoSQL systems) is that:

* It strictly follows the log-structured design principle that **all writes must be append-only**.
* It **couples the index-base-table sync-up with the compaction**.

By this design, ``DELI`` preserves the performance characteristic of original HBase (i.e. write optimized) while adding support for secondary index. Details can be found in the referenced research paper below, which is published in [[CCGrid 2015](http://cloud.siat.ac.cn/ccgrid2015/)].


Demo
---

1. Install ``docker`` on your machine; [[link](https://www.docker.com)]  
2. Launch the ``docker`` container running ``DELI`` image.  

    ```bash
    sudo docker run -i -t tristartom/deli-hadoop-hbase-ubuntu /bin/bash 
    ```
3. Inside the container's bash, run the following to demonstrate a DELI client program.  
    ```bash
    #step 0                       
    source ~/.profile
    
    #step 1: first start hdfs                       
    cd ~/app/hadoop-2.6.0 
    bin/hdfs namenode -format 
    sbin/start-dfs.sh  
    
    #step 2: then run hbase                         
    cd ~/app/hbase-0.99.2 
    bin/start-hbase.sh  
    
    #step 3: run deli demo program
    cd ~/app/deli
    ant #compile the deli client
    ./tt_sh/run.sh #demonstrate data can be accessed through a value-based Get (GetByIndex).
    ```

If you observe ``Result is key1`` by the end of printout, it means the demo runs successfully. The demo source code can be found in ``~/app/deli/src/tthbase/client/Demo.java``
